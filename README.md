**General Overview** - The NyTimes React App, is a web application that captures the headline from http://www.nytimes.com based on a 'User's' search query that requires topic, start year, and start year for the most effective results that can be saved properly. However the 'User' can do a quick search and just enter the topic and 'Search' for immediate results.

**Instructions** - Once results are displayed, each article provides the 'User' with the option to save their favorite Article/search result using the green "Save" button located at the bottom of each result. The saved article will now appear in the "Saved Articles" section at the bottom of this 1-page application. Additionally, each 'Saved Article' provides an option to delete the result using the red "Delete" button located on the the bottom of each saved article entry.

**Comments** - The NyTimes React App demonstrates CRUD, four basic functions of persistent storage, using MongoDB within a REACT built application.
